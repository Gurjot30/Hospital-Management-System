# Hospital-Management-System

I developed a Hospital Database Management System using MySQL to efficiently manage and organize information across various aspects of healthcare, including patient records, healthcare providers, and medical processes. This system streamlines data management, ensuring that healthcare operations are conducted smoothly and efficiently. By automating and centralizing data storage, it reduces manual errors, improves data accessibility, and enhances the overall quality of patient care. The system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for hospitals of various sizes, ultimately contributing to better healthcare delivery and administrative efficiency.
